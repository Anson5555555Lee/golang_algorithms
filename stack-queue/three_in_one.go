// Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
// Hints: #2, #12, #38, #58

// Solution #1 fixed division
// We can divide the array in three equal parts and allow the individual stack to grow in that limited space.
// Note: We will use the notation "[" to mean inclusive of an end point and "(" to exclusive of an end point.

// Only including fixed stack size solution.
// Book states variable solution is too complex for an interview.
