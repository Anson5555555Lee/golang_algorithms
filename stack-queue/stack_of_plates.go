// Image a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
// Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold.
// Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of
// several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
// SetOfStacks.Push() and SetOfStacks().Pop() should behave identically to a single stack
// Hints: #64, #81
