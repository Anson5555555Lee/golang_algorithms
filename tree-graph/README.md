## Tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property: all left descendents <= n < all right descendents 

The definition of a binary search tree can vary slightly with respect to equality. 

Note that this inequity must be true for all of a node's descendents, not just its immediate children. 

**Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree**

**Balanced vs Unbalanced**

**Complete Binary Trees**
Every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level. To that extend that
the last level is filled, it is filled left to right. 

**Full Binary Trees**
A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. That is, no nodes have only one child.
